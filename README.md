# Vim Setup Script
A Linux shell script to install my vim setup.  
Initially scripted for me to install quickly on university lab machines and newly set up machines at home, but now used for any remote/new machine setup for quick terminal editing.  
*Removed YouCompleteMe from scripts so no need for root any more*
*Overhauled vimrc file used on 4/4/2024*
